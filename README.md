# 🏙️ Procedural City Builder
### Code Complexity Visualization in 3D

This project autonomously analyzes the source code of the **Autogit** ecosystem and transforms it into a generative 3D cityscape. Each building in the city represents a Python component (Class, Method, or Function), where the architecture reflects the underlying logic.

## 🚀 Live Demo
Deploy this folder to **Vercel** or **GitHub Pages** to see the interactive 3D viewer. Because it is static-based, the "Evolution" is powered by GitHub Actions.

## 🧠 How it Works
1.  **Analysis**: The `evolve.py` script uses the `radon` library to compute the **Cyclomatic Complexity** of all scripts in the ecosystem.
2.  **Mapping**:
    *   **Blue Buildings**: Represent Python **Classes**.
    *   **Red Buildings**: Represent high-complexity functions (CC > 10).
    *   **Grey Buildings**: Represent standard functions.
    *   **Height**: Corresponds to the complexity score relative to the average.
3.  **Visualization**: The frontend uses **Three.js** to render a cyberpunk-inspired terminal city with fog, shadows, and interactive tooltips.

## 🛠️ Local Development

### 1. Step: Generate Data
Run the analyzer to update the city structure based on the current state of the code.
```bash
pip install radon
python3 evolve.py
```

### 2. Step: View the City
Start a local server to bypass browser security restrictions for loading JSON files.
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Visit **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)** in your browser.

## 🎮 Interaction
- **Rotate**: Left-click + Drag
- **Zoom**: Scroll
- **Pan**: Right-click + Drag
- **Inspect**: Hover over any building to see the **Metadata HUD** (Name, Type, Complexity, and Source File).

## 🤖 Autonomy
This project is part of the **Autogit** ecosystem. It features an automated GitHub Action that:
- Runs every day at 00:00 UTC.
- Analyzes the latest code changes.
- Commits a fresh `city.json` to the repository.
- Triggers an automatic redeploy of the web viewer.
