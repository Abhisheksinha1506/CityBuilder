# 🏙️ Procedural City Builder
### Code Complexity Visualization in 3D

This project autonomously analyzes the source code of the **Autogit** ecosystem and transforms it into a generative 3D cityscape. Each building in the city represents a Python component (Class, Method, or Function), where the architecture reflects the underlying logic.

## 🚀 Live Demo
Deploy this folder to **Vercel** or **GitHub Pages** to see the interactive 3D viewer. Because it is static-based, the "Evolution" is powered by GitHub Actions.

## 🧠 How it Works
1.  **Discovery**: The `evolve.py` engine crawls the **GitHub API** for the `Abhisheksinha1506` account, discovering all primary repositories (Districts).
2.  **Mapping**:
    *   **Blue Buildings**: Represent Classes or core evolve scripts.
    *   **Red Buildings**: Represent high-volume "Nucleus" files.
    *   **Grey Buildings**: Represent standard data units.
    *   **Height**: Corresponds to file size/metatdata as a proxy for complexity.
3.  **Visualization**: The frontend uses **Three.js** to render a cyberpunk metropolis with high-granularity details (antennas, helipads, street lights) and a gamer HUD.

## 🛠️ Local Development
To run the analyzer locally using your system's code structure:
```bash
python3 evolve.py
```
*(Note: If no `GITHUB_TOKEN` is found, it will fallback to local directory analysis).*

## 🎮 Interaction
- **Rotate**: Left-click + Drag
- **Zoom**: Scroll
- **Pan**: Right-click + Drag
- **Inspect**: Hover over any building to see the **Metadata HUD** (Name, Type, Complexity, and Source File).

## 🤖 Autonomy
The city is fully self-evolving. The GitHub Action:
- Runs every **10 minutes**.
- Crawls the entire ecosystem via the GitHub API.
- Commits updates to `city.json` automatically when code changes are detected.
